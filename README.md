# Advanced-Robotics

 ## This repository contains my **Advanced-Robotics** course projects:

We utilized a robot named **Vector** in our project.
:one: At the first phase of the project, the **Sensor Model** and  **Motion Model** of a robot has been investigated. We utilized an **odometry method** in order to identify the Motion Model of the robot. 

 :two: In the second phase of the project we utilized the models has been drived in the previous phase in order to implement a **Particle Filter** algorithm for localization of the robot. Moreover, by some modifications the initial algorithm has been developed to cope with the problem of **Kindanpping**.
