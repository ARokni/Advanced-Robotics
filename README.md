# Advanced-Robotics

 ## This repository contains my **Advanced-Robotics** course projects:

We utilized a robot named [**`Vector`**](https://www.amazon.com/Vector-Robot-Anki-Hangs-Helps/dp/B07G3ZNK4Y) in our project.

:one: In the first phase of the project,  **`Sensor Model`** and  **`Motion Model`** of the robot(**Vector**) has been investigated. We utilized an **`odometry method`** in order to identify the Motion Model of the robot. 

 :two: In the second phase of the project we utilized the models has been drived in the previous phase in order to implement a **`Particle Filter`** algorithm for localization of the robot. Moreover, by some modifications the initial algorithm has been developed to slove the problem of **`Kindanpping`**.
